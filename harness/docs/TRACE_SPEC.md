# Trace Specification

The `trace` table records what happened during a Harness task. This document
defines the expected depth and format for each field so traces are useful for
review, benchmark scoring, failure attribution, and future harness evolution.

The current schema lives in `scripts/schema/001-init.sql` under the `trace`
table. The schema is not changed by Phase 2.

## Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | INTEGER | Automatic | SQLite autoincrement primary key. Do not set manually. | `42` |
| `created_at` | TEXT | Automatic | SQLite `datetime('now')`. Do not set manually. | `2026-05-27 09:24:37` |
| `task_summary` | TEXT | Yes | One sentence, at least 10 characters, naming the outcome or attempted outcome. | `Completed Phase 2 docs-only observability and taxonomy specification` |
| `intake_id` | INTEGER | Standard+ when an intake was recorded | Integer id from the related `intake` row. | `36` |
| `story_id` | TEXT | Standard+ when work maps to one story | Story id from the `story` table. Use the main story when one trace covers several; list the rest in `notes`. | `US-004` |
| `agent` | TEXT | Optional for minimal; Standard+ expected | Short agent/tool name. | `codex` |
| `actions_taken` | TEXT | Standard+ | JSON array text. With the current CLI, pass a comma-separated list and the CLI stores JSON text. | `["read PHASE2.md","drafted TRACE_SPEC.md","updated HARNESS.md"]` |
| `files_read` | TEXT | Standard+ | JSON array text of paths or command names. With the current CLI, pass a comma-separated list. | `["PHASE2.md","docs/HARNESS.md","scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix"]` |
| `files_changed` | TEXT | Standard+ | JSON array text of changed file paths. With the current CLI, pass a comma-separated list; omit only when no files changed. | `["docs/TRACE_SPEC.md","docs/HARNESS.md"]` |
| `decisions_made` | TEXT | Detailed | JSON array text of decision strings. Include scope decisions, validation choices, and explicit non-goals. | `["Kept Phase 2 docs-only; installer propagation remains out of scope"]` |
| `errors` | TEXT | Standard+ if errors occurred; Detailed always | JSON array text of error or blocker strings. Until the CLI supports empty arrays directly, use `none` when a detailed trace needs explicit no-error evidence. | `["git diff --check failed before whitespace fix"]` |
| `outcome` | TEXT | Yes before final response | One of `completed`, `blocked`, `partial`, or `failed`. | `completed` |
| `duration_seconds` | INTEGER | Detailed when available | Positive integer estimate or measured duration. Leave null if unknown. | `1800` |
| `token_estimate` | INTEGER | Detailed when available | Positive integer estimate. Leave null if unknown. | `24000` |
| `harness_friction` | TEXT | Standard+ when friction exists; Detailed always | Free text naming what was hard, missing, ambiguous, or repeated. Use `none` only when the agent actively checked and found no friction. | `New Phase 2 docs are not in installer copy list; recorded as out-of-scope follow-up.` |
| `notes` | TEXT | Optional | Free text for review context that does not fit other fields. | `Trace covers US-003, US-004, US-005, and US-006.` |

## Quality Tiers

### Minimal (score: 1)

Minimum fields:

- `task_summary` is filled and at least 10 characters.
- `outcome` is filled before the final response.

Acceptable for:

- Tiny-lane tasks with no file changes or only low-risk copy/doc edits.

Not acceptable for:

- Normal or high-risk work.
- Any work that discovered friction, errors, or a missing validation path.

### Standard (score: 2)

Minimum fields:

- All Minimal fields.
- `intake_id` when an intake was recorded.
- `story_id` when the work maps cleanly to one story.
- `agent`.
- `actions_taken` as JSON array text.
- `files_read` as JSON array text.
- `files_changed` as JSON array text.
- At least one of `errors` or `harness_friction`.

Required for:

- Normal-lane tasks.
- Tiny tasks that changed Harness instructions, validation expectations, or
  durable records.

Standard traces may leave `duration_seconds`, `token_estimate`, and
`decisions_made` empty when those details are not useful.

### Detailed (score: 3)

Minimum fields:

- All Standard fields.
- `decisions_made` as JSON array text.
- `errors` as JSON array text, using `none` with the current CLI when no
  errors occurred.
- `harness_friction`, using `none` only after checking for friction.
- `duration_seconds` or a note explaining why duration is unavailable.
- `token_estimate` or a note explaining why token estimate is unavailable.
- `notes` when one trace covers multiple stories, multiple risk flags, or
  skipped validation.

Required for:

- High-risk tasks.
- Changes touching architecture direction, source-of-truth hierarchy,
  validation requirements, auth, authorization, data loss, audit/security, or
  external provider behavior.
- Benchmark or release work where later review needs precise proof.

For high-risk work, `decisions_made` in the trace summarizes what was decided.
It does not replace a durable decision record. If the work changes behavior,
architecture, authorization, data ownership, API shape, or validation
requirements, add a `docs/decisions/NNNN-*.md` file and record it with
`scripts/bin/harness-cli decision add`.

## Lane Mapping

| Lane | Expected Tier | Minimum Trace Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | Minimal | Record summary and outcome; use Standard if friction or Harness docs changed. |
| Normal | Standard | Record intake, actions, files read, files changed, outcome, and friction/errors. |
| High-risk | Detailed | Record all fields or explicitly explain unavailable duration/token estimates. |

## Friction Capture Protocol

Populate `harness_friction` when any of these occur:

- The agent had to infer a missing rule or source of truth.
- Required validation was unclear, unavailable, or too expensive to run.
- A document, durable record, or story packet was stale or contradictory.
- The task revealed a repeated manual step that should become a template,
  command, or checklist.
- A requested change was out of scope but likely important later.
- A benchmark or review failure could not be attributed to a component.

How to write friction:

- Name the concrete pain, not a vague mood.
- Include the missing capability or contradiction.
- If the friction should become work, also add or update a backlog item with
  `scripts/bin/harness-cli backlog add`.
- If there was no friction, use `none` only for Detailed traces.

Good friction:

```text
New Phase 2 docs are not copied by scripts/install-harness.sh, but installer
propagation is out of scope for docs-only Phase 2.
```

Weak friction:

```text
docs confusing
```

## Examples

### Good Trace (Detailed)

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli trace \
  --summary "Completed high-risk auth role migration with audit proof" \
  --intake 51 \
  --story US-014 \
  --agent codex \
  --outcome completed \
  --duration 4200 \
  --tokens 52000 \
  --actions "read access-control docs,created migration,updated audit tests,ran integration suite" \
  --read "docs/product/permissions.md,docs/decisions/0008-auth-boundary.md,src/auth/roles.ts" \
  --changed "src/auth/roles.ts,src/audit/events.ts,tests/auth-roles.test.ts" \
  --decisions "kept manager role scoped to workspace,recorded audit event on every role change" \
  --errors "none" \
  --friction "Existing permission docs did not define delegated admin; added backlog item for role glossary." \
  --notes "Detailed trace required because the task touched authorization and audit behavior."
```

### Adequate Trace (Standard)

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli trace \
  --summary "Added Phase 2 trace specification and Harness reference" \
  --intake 36 \
  --story US-004 \
  --agent codex \
  --outcome completed \
  --actions "read PHASE2.md,drafted TRACE_SPEC.md,updated HARNESS.md,ran rg checks" \
  --read "PHASE2.md,docs/HARNESS.md,scripts/schema/001-init.sql" \
  --changed "docs/TRACE_SPEC.md,docs/HARNESS.md" \
  --friction "none"
```

### Insufficient Trace

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli trace \
  --summary "did phase 2" \
  --outcome completed
```

Why this is insufficient for normal-lane Phase 2 work:

- It does not identify actions.
- It does not list files read or changed.
- It does not connect to intake or stories.
- It gives no friction or error signal.

## Review Checklist

Before the final response, check:

- The trace tier matches the lane.
- Review the score printed automatically by `scripts/bin/harness-cli trace`.
  Use `scripts/bin/harness-cli score-trace --id N` when re-checking a specific
  historical trace.
- `files_changed` matches the actual changed-file set at a useful level.
- `errors` names real blockers or is `none` for Detailed traces when the
  current CLI is used.
- `harness_friction` either names a concrete issue or is intentionally `none`.
- Any friction that should become future work is recorded in the backlog.
