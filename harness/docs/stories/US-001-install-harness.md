# US-001 Install Harness Into A Project

## Status

implemented

## Lane

normal

## Product Contract

A user can apply the Harness v0 operating files and folder structure to a
target project directory without introducing an application stack, package
scripts, CI, tests, or product implementation.

## Relevant Product Docs

- `README.md`
- `docs/HARNESS.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`
- `scripts/README.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- The installer defaults to the current directory when no target is provided.
- The installer accepts a specific target path through a command-line option or
  positional argument.
- If `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/` already exists in the target, an
  interactive install shows a warning and asks whether to `1. Merge`,
  `2. Override`, or `3. Stop`.
- If `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/` already exists in the target, a
  non-interactive install stops before writing files unless `--merge` or
  `--override` is provided.
- For repositories that already have Harness, `--merge` keeps existing
  `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, and `scripts/` paths in place and creates only missing
  Harness files.
- For older Harness installs, `--merge --refresh-agent-shim` backs up
  `AGENTS.md`, replaces the old generated Harness operating guide with the
  small stable shim when detected, and otherwise appends or updates only the
  marked Harness block.
- A piped remote install can still ask interactive questions through the
  controlling terminal when `--yes` is not provided.
- Existing non-protected files are not overwritten by default.
- Forced overwrites create a timestamped backup before replacing non-protected
  files.
- A dry-run mode reports planned file operations without writing files.
- The installer copies only Harness v0 operating files and does not scaffold
  application code, package scripts, CI, or validation commands.
- The installer script and this installer story are not copied into target
  projects.

## Design Notes

- Commands: `scripts/install-harness.sh [--directory path] [--yes] [--force] [--merge] [--refresh-agent-shim] [--dry-run]`
- Remote install: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoangnb24/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes`
- Queries: none.
- API: none.
- Tables: none.
- Domain rules: preserve Harness v0 as a generic, spec-intake-first operating
  framework.
- UI surfaces: terminal prompts and summary output only.

## Validation

| Layer | Expected proof |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Shell syntax check for `scripts/install-harness.sh`. |
| Integration | Dry-run into a temporary target reports expected file creation and AGENTS shim refresh behavior. |
| E2E | Install into a temporary target creates the harness file structure and can refresh an existing old generated `AGENTS.md` into the shim. |
| Platform | POSIX shell execution on the local macOS environment. |
| Release | Not applicable until packaging exists. |

## Harness Delta

Adds the first real harness automation script while keeping installer internals
out of target projects and preserving the Harness v0 rule that application
implementation surfaces are not scaffolded.

## Evidence

- `bash -n scripts/install-harness.sh`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$LOCAL_TARGET" --yes`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$README_TARGET" --yes` after adding a
  custom `README.md` in the target
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$AGENTS_CONFLICT" --yes`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$DOCS_CONFLICT" --yes`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$SCRIPTS_CONFLICT" --yes --force`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$NONINTERACTIVE_MERGE" --merge --yes`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$OLD_AGENTS_TARGET" --merge --refresh-agent-shim --yes`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$CUSTOM_AGENTS_TARGET" --merge --refresh-agent-shim --yes`
- `scripts/install-harness.sh --directory "$NONINTERACTIVE_OVERRIDE" --override --yes`
- interactive conflict prompt with `1` choice to merge missing files
- interactive conflict prompt with `2` choice to back up and override protected
  paths
- interactive conflict prompt with `3` or default choice to stop without writing
  files
- `HARNESS_SOURCE_BASE_URL="file:///Users/themrb/Documents/personal/repository-harness" bash -s -- --directory "$REMOTE_TARGET" --yes < scripts/install-harness.sh`
- `curl -fsSL "file:///Users/themrb/Documents/personal/repository-harness/scripts/install-harness.sh" | HARNESS_SOURCE_BASE_URL="file:///Users/themrb/Documents/personal/repository-harness" bash -s -- --directory "$TARGET" --yes`
- `HARNESS_SOURCE_BASE_URL="file:///Users/themrb/Documents/personal/repository-harness" bash -s -- --directory "$DRY_TARGET" --yes --dry-run < scripts/install-harness.sh`

Validated behaviors: dry-run writes no files, real install creates the harness
structure, existing `README.md` is left untouched by default, non-interactive
targets containing `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/` stop with a warning
before writing files unless `--merge` or `--override` is provided, merge keeps
existing protected paths in place while adding missing Harness files, agent
shim refresh backs up `AGENTS.md` and either replaces old generated Harness
guides or appends the marked Harness block to custom files,
interactive users can stop, merge missing files, or back up and override
protected paths even when the script is piped into a shell, remote-source mode
works when the script is piped into a shell, and target projects do not receive
`scripts/install-harness.sh` or this installer story.
