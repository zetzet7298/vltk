# Phase 5 Progress

## 2026-06-04

- Implemented compiled and registered tool registry commands.
- Implemented batch story verification.
- Implemented intervention table, add command, and query filters.
- Implemented context scoring command.
- Implemented drift audit and entropy score.
- Implemented rule-based improvement proposals with optional backlog commit.
- Added Phase 5 reference docs and proposal decision record.
- Rebuilt `scripts/bin/harness-cli` from the current release build;
  `--version` reports `harness-cli 0.1.8`.
- Current local proof:
  - `cargo fmt --check` passed.
  - `cargo test --workspace` passed with 25 tests.
  - `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` passed.
  - `scripts/bin/harness-cli story verify-all` passed: 21 stories checked,
    11 passed, 0 failed, 10 skipped without `verify_command`.
  - `scripts/bin/harness-cli audit` passed with entropy score 0/100.
  - `scripts/bin/harness-cli propose` generated proposals from repeated
    friction/intervention seed data.
  - Temporary-DB CLI smoke covered `query tools`, `tool register/remove`,
    invalid tool registration, `story verify-all` pass/fail/skip,
    `intervention add/query`, `score-context`, `audit`, `propose`, and
    `propose --commit`.
- Benchmark attempt:
  - Prepared local benchmark snapshot `/tmp/harness-experimental` on branch
    `local-phase5-benchmark` at `d42a347`.
  - Started
    `/Users/tubakhuym/Documents/harness-benchmark/benchmark/run.sh --agent codex --harness local-phase5-benchmark --run-id phase-5-evolution-infrastructure-20260604`.
  - Stopped the run during T1 because the benchmark installer downloaded the
    published CLI and copied only schema 001/002, so the run would not exercise
    the local Phase 5 CLI/schema implementation.
  - Recorded backlog item #8 for a benchmark/local installer path or installer
    propagation follow-up.

## Remaining Proof

- Run benchmark comparison against the Phase 4 baseline after the benchmark
  install path can exercise the Phase 5 CLI/schema state.
