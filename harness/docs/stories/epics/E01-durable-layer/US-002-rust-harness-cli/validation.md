# Validation

## Proof Strategy

Prove the Rust CLI command contract against a temporary SQLite database. Each
command should be tested through the stable `scripts/bin/harness-cli` entrypoint and
verified against durable records.

## Test Plan

| Layer | Cases |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Parse command flags into typed values; reject invalid lanes, statuses, booleans, and missing required flags. |
| Integration | Create a temp database, apply schema, run migrated use cases, and verify rows with SQLite queries. |
| E2E | Install Harness into a temp target, download or locate the prebuilt CLI, run `scripts/bin/harness-cli init`, `intake`, `query intakes`, and `trace`. |
| Platform | Verify supported macOS, Linux, and Windows binary selection, checksum validation, and clear unsupported-platform errors. |
| Performance | Query commands should remain fast on small local databases; no benchmark gate until larger trace volumes exist. |
| Logs/Audit | Trace writes remain available through `scripts/bin/harness-cli trace` and `scripts/bin/harness-cli query traces`. |

## Fixtures

- Temporary target project with no existing Harness files.
- Temporary target project with existing Harness files for merge behavior.
- Temporary SQLite database seeded with `scripts/schema/001-init.sql`.
- Release-artifact fixture or local file server for installer download tests.

Windows PowerShell smoke:

## Acceptance Evidence

- `cargo fmt --check`: passed.
- `cargo test --workspace`: passed, 10 tests, including regression coverage
  for repo-root decision verification and SQL `NULL` intake list storage.
- `bash -n scripts/install-harness.sh`: passed.
- `scripts/bin/harness-cli --help`: passed.
- `bash -n scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh`: passed.
- `.github/workflows/harness-cli-release.yml`: added to verify the workspace,
  build the four supported CLI release targets on hosted native runners, and
  publish `harness-cli-<platform>` plus `.sha256` assets to the GitHub Release
  for `v*` or `harness-cli-v*` tags.
- `scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh`: passed and wrote
  `dist/harness-cli-macos-arm64` plus checksum.
- Temporary database smoke passed through the Rust delegated command paths:
  `init`, `migrate`, `import brownfield`, `intake`, `story add`, `story
  update`, `decision add`, `decision verify`, `backlog add`, `backlog close`,
  `trace`, `query matrix`, `query backlog`, `query decisions`, `query
  intakes`, `query traces`, `query friction`, `query stats`, and `query sql`.
- Brownfield import fixture test passed: existing Harness v0 markdown seeded a
  story from `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`, a decision from `docs/decisions/`, and
  multiple backlog items from `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`; rerunning the importer
  did not duplicate backlog rows.
- Installer E2E passed using the local `dist` release source. It downloaded
  `scripts/bin/harness-cli`, verified the checksum, ran `scripts/bin/harness-cli init`,
  recorded an intake, and queried stats without relying on a local Cargo build
  inside the target project.
- Checksum failure test passed: a corrupt `.sha256` file caused the installer
  to stop before accepting the binary.
- Existing `.gitignore` merge test passed: custom rules were preserved while
  `harness.db` and `scripts/bin/harness-cli` ignore rules were appended.
- Real tag release passed: `harness-cli-v0.1.2` completed the `Harness CLI
  Release` workflow, including verify, `macos-arm64`, `macos-x64`,
  `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, and publish jobs.
- GitHub Release verification passed: `harness-cli-v0.1.2` is the latest
  release and contains exactly eight expected assets:
  `harness-cli-macos-arm64`, `harness-cli-macos-arm64.sha256`,
  `harness-cli-macos-x64`, `harness-cli-macos-x64.sha256`,
  `harness-cli-linux-x64`, `harness-cli-linux-x64.sha256`,
  `harness-cli-linux-arm64`, and `harness-cli-linux-arm64.sha256`.
- Windows release extension expects two additional assets on the next CLI
  release: `harness-cli-windows-x64.exe` and
  `harness-cli-windows-x64.exe.sha256`.
- Remote installer smoke passed from raw GitHub `main` plus
  `releases/latest/download`: the installer downloaded and verified the
  `macos-arm64` binary, preserved executable bits for `scripts/bin/harness-cli` and
  `scripts/bin/harness-cli`, and the installed command ran `init`, `intake`,
  `query stats`, and `import brownfield`.
