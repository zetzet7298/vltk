# Phase 2 Progress

## Scope

Phase 2 is docs-only observability and taxonomy work from `PHASE2.md`.

Allowed changes:

- Markdown under `docs/`.
- `AGENTS.md`.
- Durable Harness records through `scripts/bin/harness-cli`.

Out of scope:

- Rust code.
- SQLite schema.
- Shell scripts.
- GitHub workflows.
- Installer propagation.
- Benchmark tooling.

## Story Sequence

| Story | Deliverable | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| US-003 | `docs/HARNESS_COMPONENTS.md` | implemented | Inventory and component taxonomy. |
| US-005 | `docs/HARNESS_MATURITY.md` | implemented | H0-H5 maturity ladder. |
| US-004 | `docs/TRACE_SPEC.md` | implemented | Trace field and quality-tier spec. |
| US-006 | `docs/CONTEXT_RULES.md` | implemented | Dynamic context rules by phase and lane. |

## Progress Log

- 2026-05-27: Recorded Phase 2 intake and durable story rows for US-003,
  US-004, US-005, and US-006.
- 2026-05-27: Drafted `docs/HARNESS_COMPONENTS.md`,
  `docs/HARNESS_MATURITY.md`, `docs/TRACE_SPEC.md`, and
  `docs/CONTEXT_RULES.md`.
- 2026-05-27: Added required references in `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/HARNESS.md`, added Phase 2 terms to `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, and recorded
  installer propagation as out-of-scope backlog item #2.
- 2026-05-27: Inspected `/Users/tubakhuym/Documents/harness-benchmark`.
  Benchmark execution was not run because the runner installs Harness from a
  git ref through `scripts/install-harness.sh`, and installer propagation for
  the new Phase 2 docs is explicitly out of scope for this docs-only goal.

## Validation Notes

Phase 2 is docs-only. Unit proof means static acceptance checks on document
content. Integration proof means cross-reference checks across `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/HARNESS.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, and the durable Harness matrix.

E2E proof and platform proof are not applicable to these stories because no app
behavior, CLI behavior, installer behavior, workflow, or runtime platform
behavior changes in Phase 2.
